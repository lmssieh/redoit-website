			<p>
				<!-- Thank you for choosing to be part of redoit community.  -->
				Your privacy is important to us and we are committed to protecting your
				personal information. It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding
				any information we may collect from you across our website and
				applications.

					What information do we collect?
				</h4>
				<p>
					We only ask for personally identifying information when we truly need
					it to provide a service to you (i.e. your email address to provision
					your account). We only retain collected information for as long as
					necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we
					store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent
					loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying,
					use or modification.
				</p>
				<p>
					We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or
					navigate our website. This information does not reveal your specific
					identity (like your name or contact information) but may include
					device and usage information, such as your browser, operating system,
					referring URLs, country and other technical information. This
					information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation
					of our website, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
					Unlike many businesses, we don't collect information through cookies
					and similar technologies.

					How do we handle your third-party accounts?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Our service offers you the ability to connect your third-party account
					details (like your Google account). Where you choose to do this, we
					will receive certain profile information about you from third-party
					provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the
					third-party provider concerned, and only a bare minimum needed to
					provide a service to you is stored (usually just your username or
					email address of your third-party provider account).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4 class="font-bold text-size-[1.4em] py-4">
					Will your information be shared with anyone?
				</h4>
				<p>
					We share personally identifying information with our third-party
					service providers that we use to provide hosting, backup, storage,
					payment processing, analytics and other services for us. These
					third-party service providers may have access to or process your
					personal information for the purpose of providing their services to
					us. Your application data outside of your personal information (like
					your tasks, notes etc.) is end-to-end encrypted and we and our
					third-party service providers don’t have access to information it
					contains.
